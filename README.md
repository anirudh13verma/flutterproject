# The Flutter Project COMBO

This is the demo projects of **flutter** which you all can **DOWNLOAD** OR **CLONE** for testing as well as further working on the project

### Getting Started

- **DOWNLOAD** the repository as a **.zip** (NOT RECOMMENDED) OR **CLONE** the repository by pasting any of the following code in your terminal

```
gh repo clone anirudh13verma/flutterproject
```
```
git clone https://github.com/anirudh13verma/flutterproject.git
```

- Go to the **Root Directory** of **FLUTTER** Project

```
cd flutterproject/defaultproject
```

- **Run** the flutter default project to have a quick peek of the tap game!

```
flutter run
```

**NOTE** : Since this is the *initial stage* of the project *without any compilation* to *reduce the size* of the project, it might take *some time* to compile the project
